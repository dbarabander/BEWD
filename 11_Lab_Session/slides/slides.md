##Review
###Routes, Views, Controllers and Forms

* What's the difference between an object and a class. 
* Is a model an object? 
* What code goes in a model? 
* What code goes in a controller? 
* What is an _action_ ? 
* What do we mean by logicless view? 
* Traditionally how do you name a view? 
* What is a partial? 

---

## How to approach an app

* Start with the parts you understand better. Said another way, start with the easier stuff. Just get your brain moving. 
* Think about your resources. How many will you need? (Will you need just `/shirts` or will you also need a `/orders`). 
* Think about what kind of code is _Domain Logic_ (models); and what kind of code is _work flow_ (controllers), and what code is presentational (view). 

---

##The parts!
You always need at least the following: 

* A route (use `resources` whenever it makes sense!)
* A controller
* An action in the controller. 
* A model (maybe...) with some domain logic. 
* A view! 
* What else?
